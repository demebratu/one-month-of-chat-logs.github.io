this repo posts [the node.js irc channel logs](http://static.izs.me/irclogs/node.js/)
in a way that individual irc messages are indexed by google.

the list of messages and corresponding links are listed [here](http://he-said-she-said.github.io).

this is only one month of those chat logs, so there are something like 42,500 individual messages, so those are posted at unique url's of the following form:


```text
http://one-month-of-chat-logs.github.io/docs/<year>/<month>/<day>/<hours>_<minutes>_<seonds>_<irc handle>.txt
```

for example:

```text
http://one-month-of-chat-logs.github.io/docs/2013/5/9/0_0_1_lamalex.txt
```

these can be searched with something like [this](https://www.google.com/#q=site:http%3A%2F%2Fone-month-of-chat-logs.github.io+security):
