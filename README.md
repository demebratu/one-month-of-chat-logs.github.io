this repo posts [the node.js irc channel logs](http://static.izs.me/irclogs/node.js/)
in a way that individual irc messages are indexed by google.

the list of messages and corresponding links are listed [here](http://one-month-of-chat-logs.github.io).

this is only one month of those chat logs, so there are something like 42,500 individual messages, so those are posted at unique url's of the following form:

```text
http://one-month-of-chat-logs.github.io/docs/<year>/<month>/<day>/<hours>_<minutes>_<seonds>_<irc handle>.txt
```

[for example](http://one-month-of-chat-logs.github.io/docs/2012/7/9/0_27_0_rrjamie.txt):

```text
http://one-month-of-chat-logs.github.io/docs/2012/7/9/0_27_0_rrjamie.txt
```

these can be searched with something like [this](https://www.google.com/#q=site:http%3A%2F%2Fone-month-of-chat-logs.github.io+security):

FUN FACT: we also tried to do the full year of 650,000 messages. google didn't feel like indexing all of that, but it's still posted [here](https://github.com/he-said-she-said/he-said-she-said.github.io).
